### Hi ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm a third-year software engineering student at McMaster University with an interest in cyber security and software development. I started coding in grade 12 creating an encryption software for my first big project. Now with 3+ coding experience in a wide range of languages such as Java, Python, and C, I am in search of my next big project.
