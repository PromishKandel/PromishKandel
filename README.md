### Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm Promish, a passionate software engineering student with an interest in neural networks and computer vision, Iâ€™m keen on learning how machine learning can be applied to solve complex statistical problems, such as the correlation between global liquidity and various asset classes.

In my most recent co-ops, I utilized C# and .NET to divide diverse datasets into multiple entities to reveal hidden connections. Additionally, I have experience in developing cross-browser, multi-platform web applications using React.js and Tailwind CSS, with MongoDB as the primary database. These web applications are compiled using Vite and Node.js and are tested with tools such as Fiddler for API calls and network interruptions, along with a wide range of test cases to meet user requirement. 

I enjoy being part of a team and am always on the lookout for a mentor to help me learn and apply new technologies.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make a personal website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript inorder to learn the foundation of web development.
